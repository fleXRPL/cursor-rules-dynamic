# Setup and Run Script Documentation

## Overview

The `setup_and_run.sh` script is a bash wrapper that manages the Python virtual environment and dependencies for the `standardize_rules.py` script. It ensures all necessary dependencies are installed and the script runs in an isolated environment.

## Features

- ðŸŒŸ Automatic virtual environment creation and management
- ðŸ“¦ Dependency installation via requirements.txt
- ðŸ”„ Environment cleanup after execution
- ðŸŽ¨ Colorized output for better visibility

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Bash shell environment
- Write permissions in the script directory

## Usage

```bash
bash scripts/setup_and_run.sh
```

## Script Flow

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Creates a virtual environment in `.venv` if it doesn't exist
   - Creates `requirements.txt` if it doesn't exist with required packages:
     - pathlib
     - python-dateutil

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Activates the virtual environment
   - Installs all required packages from requirements.txt

3. **Script Execution**
   - Runs standardize_rules.py in the virtual environment
   - Handles any script output or errors

4. **Cleanup**
   - Deactivates the virtual environment
   - Provides execution status

## Output Colors

- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Setup and processing steps
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Success messages and completion
- ðŸ”µ Blue: Cleanup operations

## Directory Structure

```bash
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup_and_run.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ standardize_rules.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ setup_and_run.md
```

## Error Handling

- Exits on any error (set -e)
- Provides clear error messages
- Ensures virtual environment is properly deactivated

## Maintenance

The script is designed to be maintainable and extensible:

- Add new dependencies to `requirements.txt`
- Modify virtual environment location via `VENV_DIR`
- Customize output colors and messages
